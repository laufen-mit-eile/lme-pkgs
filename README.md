# osmium-pkgs
This is a package repository for built AUR packages and a few other items. Currently, it has a few tiny packages used, as well as a built version of [nvidia-all](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/nvidia-all) by Frogging-Family, and a customized Linux kernel that uses [linux-tkg](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg) to build. This isn't the most stable repository ever, and it has a few packages that are unmaintained.
